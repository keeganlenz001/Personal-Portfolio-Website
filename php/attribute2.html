            <p class="attribute2-paragraph">When coding, there are always going to be problems, bugs, or things that you will have to work around. Through my experience with coding, I have gotten much better at finding these issues and coming up with a solution. Sometimes these solutions are easy to find, but sometimes it requires a lot of creativity and thinking outside the box, and you can be sure that I will always make sure to find a solution to a problem, no matter how complex or hard-to-find the solution may be. This skill has grown a lot through my experience with coding, and it has helped me and others around me. When my group partner needs help figuring out why a program isn’t working as expected, I can almost always figure out what is wrong with the code. As someone who can look at all the little details of where a bug might be hiding, I can quickly find what’s wrong with the code, to make sure that my partner and I can continue to work on our project with as little hitches as possible.</p>
