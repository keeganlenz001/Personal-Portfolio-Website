            <p class="attribute3-paragraph">Coding is much different to learn than almost any other subject. This is because the industry is constantly changing, be it advances in a coding language or new features. No matter what it is, I will be sure to learn the changes, improve my knowledge and understanding of the changes, and add this newly found knowledge to my coding arsenal. It can also be noted that I was able to learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in just a little over 6 months. For me, learning these coding languages in such a short time span wasn’t as difficult as it was fun. Being able to manipulate code so that it will do what you desire was very intriguing to me, which made learning the subject matter much easier, as I find that it’s easier to learn about something that you find fascinating or useful.</p>
