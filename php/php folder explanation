The php folder houses all the other folders and files, so that they can be used for my local server, or in my case, my pc's command prompt.
The actual php code is required in order to make a contact form.
As of now the contact form should theoretically work, however, for whatever reason, no emails can be sent.

The php code is supposed to take the answers submitted in the contact form and then use the php mailer from github to send the data to a gmail account.
Using this data, an email will be made using the data submitted in the contact form, and this email will be sent to my CART gmail, so that I would be able to see who the person is that used the contact form, what their gmail is, and what message or comment they said.
After many different tutorials, I feel that I have done everything right, but still no emails can be sent.

I tried :(
