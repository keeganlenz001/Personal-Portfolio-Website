                    <p>I am very hard working. I always make sure that my finished work is the best that it can be, and I will stop at nothing until I have done the best job that I can. This is a skill that has always been highly useful to me throughout my life, but it has proven to be even more useful when it comes to coding, as coding requires a lot of dedication and effort. In all the major projects that I have done, I have made sure to give my full effort at all times. This has resulted in projects that, while not perfect, are still very good considering my coding knowledge, and the time given to complete these projects. I have always made sure that I donâ€™t need to play catch-up when it comes to these big projects, and I have always made sure to have the project  done on time.</p>
