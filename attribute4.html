                    <p>Through my time at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology, I have done several projects with many different people, and in all cases, these projects were a success. I made sure that when working with my partner there would be a lot of collaboration, as well as making sure that at all times my partner and I were on the same page and knew what to do. This allowed us to become a much better team, and as a result we were able to not only perform better, but also attempt to implement more difficult assets into our projects. In all of the major projects that I have done with a partner, I have found that we were able to establish a very good teamwork, so much so, that even after the project was over we would still keep in touch and chat during free time. After seeing how greatly good teamwork can affect the progress of a project and how much better two heads can be than one, I pride myself in providing unity and collaboration to a team when working on projects.</p>
